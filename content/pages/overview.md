# Custom Odor Delivery Devices Overview

Welcome to our innovative Custom Odor Delivery Devices, designed to revolutionize how you deliver and study odors in experimental settings. Our devices represent a breakthrough in precision and flexibility, offering a novel approach to achieving odorant vapor mixing in a carrier stream. In this overview, we'll delve into the key features, benefits, and components of these devices that have the potential to transform your research.

## Key Features

### Precise Odorant Mixing

Our Custom Odor Delivery Devices excel in achieving precise and uniform mixing of odorant vapor in a carrier stream. This level of accuracy is crucial for consistent and reproducible results in sensory research.

### Contamination Minimization

One of our primary objectives in designing these devices was to eliminate or minimize contamination between odorant channels. This ensures that each odorant remains distinct and pure, preventing unintended interactions in your experiments.

### On-the-Fly Odorant Mixtures

Flexibility is at the core of our design. Researchers can generate odorant mixtures on-the-fly, allowing for dynamic adjustments during experiments. This feature is particularly valuable for studying complex olfactory responses.

### Seamless Airflow Transition

We understand the importance of maintaining a consistent testing environment. Our devices are engineered to minimize changes in airflow to the subject when presenting odorants, ensuring smooth transitions that don't disrupt your research subjects.

### Rapid Onset and Offset

With rapid mixing capabilities, our devices offer quick odorant onset and offset, capturing the subtleties of sensory responses with precision. This speed is essential when studying the temporal aspects of olfaction.

## Surface-Free Environment

Our devices create a surface-free environment for odorant vapor mixing. This innovation significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination and eliminates the need to switch airflow streams when presenting different odorants. It simplifies experimental setups and enhances data reliability.

## Components and Schematics

To facilitate your integration of these custom odor delivery devices into your research setup, we provide detailed parts lists and schematics/CAD drawings. These resources will help you understand the device's internal structure and assist in assembly and maintenance.

## Explore the Future of Olfactory Research

Our Custom Odor Delivery Devices are poised to advance olfactory research by providing the precision and flexibility you need for groundbreaking experiments. Whether you're investigating sensory perception, neural responses, or behavior, our devices offer an innovative solution to elevate your research to new heights.
